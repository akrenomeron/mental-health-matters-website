      <p id ="destigDes">When it comes to mental health, many people like to avoid the seriousness of the topic and assume that if they do care, they will be perceived as "too weak" and "too dramatic." If you or someone you know are ever told this, remember that your feelings are valid and you should never minimize the situation because your wellness comes first. The internet has become more accessible allowing us to do more research. Be aware of the sites you are looking at because some may contain misleading information (use .edu and .gov websites). The best way to destigmatize is to talk to a professional or trusted loved one about your feelings; this allows you to be more comfortable about the topic of mental health. Lastly, if you see something online that would be helpful to others, think about posting/sharing it to spread awareness.</p>
