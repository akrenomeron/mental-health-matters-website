        <h1>MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A WEAKNESS</h1>
        <h3>Our mental health affects how we think, feel, and act, which is why it is very important people to talk about it. Nearly 19.86% adults and 15.08% children in the U.S. suffer from mental health issues. Many of these people don't get the treatment they deserve because of the fear of being shamed or judged if others find out. Those who decide to get help may be lead to the wrong areas because of lack of information or misleading information. The stigma of mental health placed in society stops people from getting the treatment they deserve. As long as we continue to educate and spread awareness to others, this can be stopped and everyone can get the help that they deserve.</h3>
